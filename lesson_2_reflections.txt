What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates the files it needs to track the repository. I need to do it to Git is paying attention to the directory and the files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area does not contain all files, like the working directory does, but the files are not yet committed to the repository. It allows you to prepare a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area allows you to control what files from the working you want to commit. You can use git diff to view what is in the staging area and the last commit to make sure you are only adding a logical change.
