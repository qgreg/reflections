When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository when you want to share or collaborate on your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You want to pull changes so that you don't overwrite work you are doing locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is a repository in GitHub that points to a parent repository. A clone is a copy of a repository. A branch is named line of commits. A fork is used to make a copy of an existing repository to edit or modify by a separate group of collaborators. A clone allows you to work on a repository separately without referencing the original. A branch allows you to manage various streams of work while protecting earlier versions.
